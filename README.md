# SparkletX

"Educational Applets"

## Welcome

This repo is a newer version of Sparklet, my failed attempt at putting together
a decent-looking website :P

I'm making this to eventually be able to host helpful learning material on here
and help other students learn more easily in school. Best of all, the site is
100% freeware (no greedy subscription plans), and the backend is also completely
open-source.

## Contributions

Feel free to make pull requests, but your code has to be readable and not have
any major security vulnerabilities or performance issues.

Also, please split up your contributions into separate pull requests, since I
might want to accept one, but I can't because it includes something unrelated.

## FOR DEVS

To get started, run `npm i` to install dependencies so your editor can do
type-checking.

Then, write a .env file with your `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` environment variables.

That's it! Now, you can start typing away!

Useful npm scripts:

```
# Runs TypeScript transpiler in watch mode (for backend)
npm run tsc

# Runs webpack in watch mode (for frontend)
npm run pw
```

VS Code tasks are set up, if you'd like to use those instead.
