# SparkletX
"Educational Applets"

## Welcome
This repo is a newer version of Sparklet, my failed
attempt at putting together a decent-looking website :P

I'm making this to eventually be able to host helpful
learning material on here and help other students
learn more easily in school. Best of all, the site is
100% freeware (no greedy subscription plans), and the
backend is also completely open-source.

## Contributions
Feel free to make pull requests, but your code has to be
readable and not have any major security
vulnerabilities or performance issues.

Also, please split up your contributions into separate
pull requests, since I might want to accept one, but I
can't because it includes something unrelated.

## FOR DEVS
BEFORE YOU START WORKING ON ANYTHING, make sure you have a symlink for
`/src/js/bootstrap.min.js` to `/node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js`.
I might make a script for doing this later, but I'll probably have to make separate
scripts for each platform.

	Useful scripts:

	>>> npm run tsc
	Runs TypeScript transpiler in watch mode (for backend)
 
	>>> npm run pw
	Runs webpack in watch mode (for frontend)
