## Contributions

Feel free to make pull requests, but your code has to be readable and not have
any major security vulnerabilities or performance issues.

Also, please split up your contributions into separate pull requests, since I
might want to accept one, but I can't because it includes something unrelated.

Vite/Vue contributions are highly appreciated, as I'm very new to those tools
and could use some help figuring out how to use them "more properly."
