# Security Policy

Sparklet isn't a huge corporation, or anything. This site is just one of my personal projects, and I
don't think sharing the code for educational purposes will result in much harm. The backend for this
site is completely open-source, so feel free to look for any vulnerabilities (as long as you report
them responsibly).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you can DM me on:
Twitter: `@__Carbonado870`
Discord: `Dexie With Drip#4213`

(I've been getting contacted by a lot of bots lately, so I had to obfuscate the contact info. For the Twitter, remove the leading _s, and for the Discord, double each digit in my # tag to get the real version. If you still don't get it, just check the version history for this file and you'll find the unobfuscated version)

Sometimes I'll be too busy to work on a patch, but usually I'll try and fix it as soon as
possible, if it's important enough that it could reveal passwords or break the site.
