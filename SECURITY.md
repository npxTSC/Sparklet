# Security Policy

Sparklet isn't a huge corporation, or anything. This site is just one of my personal projects, and I
don't think sharing the code for educational purposes will result in much harm. The backend for this
site is completely open-source, so feel free to look for any vulnerabilities (as long as you report
them responsibly).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you can message me on:
Email: `cherry@example.com`
Discord: `Cherry#1984`

I've been getting lots of spambots lately, so I had to obfuscate the contact info.
To get the real information:

- Replace the domain in the email with sparklet.org
- Put an ampersand (&) before the Discord name

Sometimes I'll be too busy to work on a patch, but usually I'll try and fix it as soon as
possible, if it's important enough that it could reveal PII / auth tokens or break the site.
