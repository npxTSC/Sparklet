                    I post my TypeScript / JavaScript experiments and labs on here once in
                    a while. I'm also trying to create a quiz / flashcards section for
                    reviewing class material and getting homework help. The site is
                    constantly being edited, so the next time you come here, it probably
                    won't be the exact same as it is now.

                    You can create an account if you want, but it's not required unless
                    you're a teacher trying to set up a quiz for the class to play.
                    Remember to never reuse passwords!
